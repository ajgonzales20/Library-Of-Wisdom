## Git Workflow

1. *Branches:* Work on separate feature branches; avoid committing directly to main.  
2. *Pull Requests:* Submit PRs for teammates to review before merging.  
3. *Conflict Resolution:* If merge conflicts occur, pull the updated main branch into your feature branch, resolve conflicts manually, and push the changes.  
4. *Review Etiquette:* Each PR must be reviewed and include at least one comment before merging.

## Assessment Checklist

- *Branching:* Did contributors use feature branches?  
- *Commit Messages:* Are commit messages descriptive (e.g., “Add MainActivity.kt”)?  
- *PR Etiquette:* Are PR descriptions clear and informative?  
- *Conflict Resolution:* Are merge conflicts resolved properly without deleting teammates’ work?
